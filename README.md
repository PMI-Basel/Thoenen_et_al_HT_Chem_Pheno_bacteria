This GitHub has the following files:
====================================

The file **GrowthCurveOD600.prt** is an example file how to program the instrument (exemplary run with regular measurements of OD600 with prior shaking during 68 h).

The file **Script_HT_Chem_Pheno.rmd** presents the R markdown script together with its output (file: **Script_HT_Chem_Pheno.html**) of the exemplary data analysis.  

The files **Strain_Data.xlsx** and **labellist.xlsx** contain the meta information of the exemplary experiment. 

The file **Sample_data_HT_Chem_Pheno.xlsx** contains the raw growth data from the plate reader of the exemplary experiment. 

The files **results_AUC_Run1.rds** and **AUC_tolind_COMP.rds** present R data storage objects generated during the exemplary data analysis.
